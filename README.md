# Gradutation

Just a code keeper for some problems I solved during graduantion (bachelor degree in software engineer at State University of Campinas).

During almost all my graduation I didn't had git knowledge or a GitHub account and let all my projects perish inside my local machine. This repository aims to avoid that from happening again and help me register my work and my porgress as a computer science student. Therefore, please forgive me for having such desorganized and incomplete documentation of it.

Subjects:

* MC348: Programming Paradigms;
* MC536: Databases: Theory and Practice;
* MC558: Algorithm Design and Analysis II;
* MC613: Digital Circuits Laboratory;
